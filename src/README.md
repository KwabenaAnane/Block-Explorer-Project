#Block Explorer

- In this assignment, I created a frontend application that consumes an ethereum blockchain.

- I used a local blockchain called Ganache.

- In this application, you can enter an address and access the current balance of the account, this is presented in the unit ether.

- You can also create a transaction and add it to the blockchain using the Create transaction button

- In addition to the above, you will also be able to find out how many blocks the blockchain consists of.
